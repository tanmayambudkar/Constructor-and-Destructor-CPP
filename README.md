# Aim: To study and implement Constructors and Destructors
# Software Required:
Visual Studio
# Theory:
In C++, constructors are special methods that are automatically called whenever an object of a class is created. The constructor in C++ has the same name as the class or structure.

<ins>Types of Constructors in C++</ins>:

Constructors can be classified based on the situations they are being used in. There are 4 types of constructors in C++:

1. Default Constructor
2. Parameterized Constructor
3. Copy Constructor

1. <ins>Default Constructor</ins>:
A default constructor is automatically generated by the compiler if the programmer does not define one. This constructor doesn't take any argument as it is parameter less and initializes object members using default values. It is also called a zero-argument constructor. However, the default constructor is not generated by the compiler if the programmer has explicitly defined a constructor.

2. <ins> Parameterized Constructor</ins>:
Parameterized constructor allow us to pass arguments to constructors. Typically, these arguments help initialize an object's members. To create a parameterized constructor, simply add parameters to it the way you would to any other function. When you define the constructor’s body, use the parameters to initialize the object's members.

3. <ins> Copy Constructor</ins>:
A copy constructor is a member function that initializes an object using another object of the same class. Copy constructor takes a reference to an object of the same class as an argument.

Characteristics of Constructors:

+ The name of the constructor is the same as its class name.
+ Constructors are mostly declared as public member of the class though they can be declared as private.
+ Constructors do not return values, hence they do not have a return type.
+ A constructor gets called automatically when we create the object of the class.
+ Multiple constructors can be declared in a single class (it is even recommended - Rule Of Three, The Rule of Five).
+ In case of multiple constructors, the one with matching function signature will be called.

<ins>Destructors</ins>:
A destructor is a special member function of a class that is executed whenever an object of it's class goes out of scope or whenever the delete expression is applied to a pointer to the object of that class. A destructor will have exact same name as the class prefixed with a tilde (~) and it can neither return a value nor can it take any parameters. Destructor can be very useful for releasing resources before coming out of the program like closing files, releasing memories etc.

# Implementation:
The concepts of Constructor and Destructor are demonstrated by the following codes,
+ Constructor of Student info
+ Vehicle info using Constructor(outside the class)
+ volume using parrameterized constructor
+ copy constructor
+ Destructor using counters

#Algorithm:

(1) Copied-Constructor
Algorithm:

Start.

Define a class Student with members for PRN and grade.

Implement a parameterized constructor to initialize PRN and grade.

Implement a copy constructor to construct a new object as a copy of an existing Student object.

Implement a `display()` function to print PRN and grade.

In `main()`:

Create a Student object with values.

Create a second Student object using the copy constructor.

Display both objects’ data.

End.

2. Default-Constructor-Inside-Class
Algorithm:

Start.

Define a class Student inside `main()` with members for roll number, name, and fee.

Implement a default constructor that prompts for and takes input for all member variables.

Add a `disp()` function to print the student’s information.

In `main()`:

Create a Student object.

Call `disp()` to display the properties.

End.

3. Default-Constructor-Outside-Class
Algorithm:

Start.

Define a class Car with mileage, name, and cost as members.

Declare a default constructor and a `display()` function as public members.

Define the constructor outside the class, prompt for input, and read values for all member variables.

Define the `display()` method outside the class to print all details.

In `main()`:

Create a Car object.

Call `display()` to show the car details.

End.

4. Destructor
Algorithm:

Start.

Define a global counter `count` = `0`.

Define a class destruct with a constructor and destructor:

Increment count in the constructor, display the count of objects created.

Decrement count in the destructor, display the count of objects destroyed.

In `main()`:

Create multiple destruct objects (for example, aa, bb, cc, and dd).

Observe messages as objects are created and destroyed.

End.

5. Parameterized-Constructor
Algorithm:

Start.

Define a class Num with two integer members `x` and `y`.

Implement a parameterized constructor to initialize `x` and `y` with given values.

Implement a `display()` method to show the values of `x` and `y`.

In `main()`:

Create a Num object with two integer arguments.

Call `display()` to print the stored values.

End.

#Conclusion:

The above codes demonstrates the use of constructors and destructors in C++.
